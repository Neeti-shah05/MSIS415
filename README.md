# MSIS415 - Song Characteristics and Popularity Prediction
This project was a group work done by Neeti Shah, Dev Patel and Gabriella Villata for our MSIS 415 class. It aims to analyze song characteristics and predict their popularity using data from Kaggle's Song Popularity Dataset. The analysis investigates various features such as danceability, energy, acousticness, instrumentalness, loudness, speechiness, tempo, and audio valence to understand their correlation with song popularity.

<b> Key Feature </b>
<ul>
<li> Data Cleaning: Unnecessary columns are dropped, and duplicate song names are removed to ensure a clean dataset. </li>
<li> Data Exploration: The top 10 most popular songs are identified, and their danceability scores are analyzed to uncover trends. </li>
<li> Correlation Analysis: Correlations between song popularity and other features are calculated and visualized to gain insights into their relationships.</li>
<li> Predictive Modeling (Future Work): Future work may involve building predictive models to forecast song popularity based on its characteristics.</li>
</ul>
<b> Repository Structure </b>
<ul> 
<li> data/: Contains the dataset used for analysis. </li>
<li> notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks detailing the data cleaning, exploration, and analysis steps.</li>
<li> scripts/: Python scripts for specific tasks such as data cleaning and visualization.</li>
<li> README.md: Overview of the project, instructions for running the code, and key findings.</li>
