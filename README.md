# MSIS415 - Song Characteristics and Popularity Prediction
This project was a group work done by Neeti Shah, Dev Patel and Gabriella Villata for our MSIS 415 class. It aims to analyze song characteristics and predict their popularity using data from Kaggle's Song Popularity Dataset(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/song-popularity-dataset/data). The analysis investigates various features such as danceability, acousticness, instrumentalness, loudness, tempo to understand their correlation with song popularity.
